>“Victory awaits him who has everything in order, luck some people call it. Defeat is certain for him who
has neglected to take necessary precautions in time; this is called bad luck.” – Roald Amundsen

I've always been concerned with making myself more productive and healthy. When I was 13, I had already tried fasting, cold showers, meditation and lots of other popular self-improvement advice. But due to my grindset, I haven't milked this knowledge enough. I could improve.

So I've made a list of some healthy habits I'd like to implement. I'll put some effort into them and see what sticks.

### List

- #### Dual N-Back

A way to train your working memory. Gwern explains it quite well [here](https://www.gwern.net/DNB-FAQ). It might not work. But if it does, the benefits are huge. For example, I could do math faster and practice the piano much more efficiently.

- #### Cold Showers

I used to take cold showers on a daily basis. And I still often take them after workouts. Cold showers are obviously [extremely beneficial](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/benefits-of-cold-showers), so I'll try to get back into the habit.

- #### Sleep

I noticed that if I don't sleep 8 hours at least, it affects me personally quite a lot. Also, healthy sleep habits have just unreal benefits (read [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)). This is probably the most important habit because my sleep has been bad lately.

- #### Waking Up Before 6:00

I just don't want to be in a hurry every morning. Maybe I'll discover more benefits along the way.

- #### Meditation

Okay, I've tried meditating regularly for a few weeks several times. It was calming, but I didn't notice any substantial benefits. So I think I might finally learn the Rosary instead of trying meditation once again.

- #### Intermittent Fasting

I tried fasting, but I stopped because I found it too risky to be playing with my diet like that. Now I feel it's okay and I'm thinking of getting into the 16:8 intermittent fasting. It's supposed to make me more concentrated, and it'll also force me to plan my meals in advance. So as a byproduct of IF, I might eat healthier.

I'll see where the positive feedback loops lead me.
