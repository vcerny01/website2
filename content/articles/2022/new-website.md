Well, I've almost finished my new website. So here's a short reflection and summary.

## Hugo

I made my new website with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) SSG. It's been great so far and certainly an upgrade from Jekyll:

- It's faster than Jekyll (Go vs Ruby)
- Great docs and active community and development
- Just a single binary (installing Jekyll took me always at least 15 mins)
- I think it's just better (I feel more productive with Hugo)


## Design

I don't enjoy doing frontend much, but I put some work into CSS this time and I think it shows.

I added some JS too, I'm not as autistic about the web as I used to be:

- Lightbox for photos
- List filters and other little tools
- Katex for rendering math 

Still it's quite fast and low on bandwith.

## Notes

Finally, the probably biggest reason why I decided to remake my website is so that I could share my [notes](/notes) here. That is all in my effort to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)

Currently I import most notes from [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/). (making it all work required quite some effort and lots of regex) I might abandon RR in the future and just write my notes directly here as I do with school notes now. My setup is quite comfy, I basically have [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) opened on the content folder and just write plain markdown with a little bit of YAML in the frontamtter.
