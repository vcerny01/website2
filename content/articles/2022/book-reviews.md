title: I'm Gonna Write (book reviews, articles..)
disable_toc: true

You may wonder (it's not very likely) why you can no longer find my notes from books here. Well, while I was remaking my website, I read some book reviews online and I realized writing book reviews is a much better way of sharing new insight from books than just dumping related notes. So I'm gonna write book reviews.

Next thing, I got access to [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), so I look forward to having amazing covers for all my texts. Maybe I'll use it to make my notes more colorful, it's really fun to use.

And yeah, I'd like to write more in general. Maybe I'll do a writing challenge or something. Or besides book reviews, I might start reviewing other things, e.g., music albums.

The first pilot book review will be obviously on Peter Thiel's Zero to One. Hopefully, I'll drop it before September. Take care, exciting times are ahead!
