## Introduction
Majority of modern thought is based on ancient authors. Learning about the ancients is basically learning about our civilization from first principles. Unfortunately, classical education is being neglected nowadays (and it shows), so I had to do it myself.

I think it's important to understand ancient philosophy in context. For example, see my notes on the history of [[ancient Greece]].

All in all, these notes were created as a part of my effort to see the world with fresh eyes as the ancients saw it.


## Notes
### Ancient Greece
The history of ancient Greek philosophy by convention starts in 585 BC (Thales predicted the solar eclipse of that year) and ends in 529 AD (Roman emperor Justinian prohibited pagans from teaching in schools)
