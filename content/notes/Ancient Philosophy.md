## Introduction
All western thought is based upon ancient authors. Unfortunately, classical education is neglected nowadays, so I had to learn it myself.

I think it's important to understand ancient philosophy in context. For example, see my notes on the history of [[ancient Greece]].

All in all, I hope these notes will help you see the world with fresh eyes, as the ancients saw it.
