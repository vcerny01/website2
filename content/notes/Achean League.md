- It was reestablished in the 3rd century BC, by Aratus of Sicycon
	- Its capital was in Megalopolis
### Revival of Sparta
- Sparta had been doing bad after since it was [[Macedonian Conquest of Greece|defeated by Macedonians]] in 331 BC. (in the [battle of Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Megalopolis))
-  Spartan king [Cleomenes III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleomenes_III) re-instituted traditional Spartan customs and Sparta underwent a revival

### Philopoemen vs. Nabis
- 209â€“192 BC
- Achean league assumed their dominant position in the Peloponnese under Philopoemen
- Nabis, a tyrant and the last Spartan king, arose in Sparta

## Achean Wars
- Philopoemen tried to keep good relations with Rome
