## Reforms
- **Complete reogranization of the citizen body**
	- Divided into 3 regions: city, coast, inland
	- Each region is divided into 10 artificial *trittyes* ("thirds", so thirty in alll)
	- Each tryttys includes a variable number of _Demes_, pre-existing "neighborhoods" (about 170 in all)
		- From individual perspective, deme was the most important as your deme identity made you a citizen
	- 10 new tribes (*Phylai*), each consisting of 3 trittyes, one from each region
		- It was supposed that every tribe would represent a cross-section of the Athenian population in equal size
	- **New council** (*Boule*)
		- Consisted of 500 men
			- Serving 1 yrear
			- 50 from each tribe elected by a lot
				- At this rate, the Boule served as a kind of education centre for the Athenian citizenry
		- Prytany system
			-  Council year is divided into tenths, with each tribe's council members serving as executive comitte (Prytaneis_) for that allotted period
		-  The Boule framed legislation, that would be then debated and voted on for ratification by the assembly
			-  It generally served as a sort of executive power
		-  The old council (Aeropagus) and archons (magistrates, 9 of them) still continue to exist, but they are routinely examined by the Boule
	-  **Board of 10 generals** (*Strategoi*)
		-  Each out of one tribe
		-  Elected anually
			-  Could be reelected without limit
	-  **Popular courts**
			-  Citizen juries of upto several hundreds to hear cases
	-  **Ostracism**
		- Official process voted on anually by the assembly
			- The vote required a qorum of 6,000 (a lot of citizens together at one place and one time)
		- The citizens were supplied with *ostraca* (just means a bit of busted pot)
		- These were deposited in collection vases and the citizen who got the most votes had to leave Athens for 10 years
			- No appeal to this
		- *Isonomia*
			- Condition of "equal law" and equality under law
