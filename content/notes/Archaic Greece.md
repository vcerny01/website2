- ==~800â€“500 BC==
## Culture
- **Homer** was very important for all subsequent ancient Greek culture
	- Memorizing Homer was part of the education of any reasonably well brought up young Greek man
- **Hesiod** is a major source for greek mythology
- Heroism
	- Not some kind of moral accomplishment, but a status
	- Criterions
		- Genealogy is the first criteria, i.e., you were the son of a hero
		- Hereos tended to be tall and good-looking
		- They had military courage and a group of retainers that would follow them with unquestionable loyalty
	- It was a remarkably fragile status (zero-sum game, it was constanly being tested)
	- *Arete*
		- = Constantly displayed virtue excellence
	- *Aristeia*
		- = Being at one's best (especially in combat)
	- *Xenia*
		- = Guest-friendship, hospitality towards foreigners and guests
- **Olympic games**
	- First games took place in 776 BC
	- Such competitions were important for establishing civil identity
- Poetry
	- The lyric poetry is associated with gods, especially with Apollo
	- Poetry was a public performance accompanied by music (lyric from lyra)
	- There was a pervasive sense of anxiety in poetry in this time (as things were changing fast)
	- Important poets

## *Polis* (pl. *poleis*)
- = "city-state"
	- A settled community with internal unity and independence from other communities
- Defined by politea_ ("constitution", "citizen body", "citizenship) much more than place
	- _Astu_
		- = The urban center of a polis
		- Polis always atsu and the land around it 
	- _Polites_ (pl. _politai_)
		- = Citizens
		- A citizen was **only** a native-born, adult, free, male
		- Citizens were equal in rights
		- Foreigners (metoikos_), women and slaves were not guaranteed these citizen rights
- Every city had a "castle" (_akropolis_) and a central public space (_agora_)
- Autonomy was important for even the smallest of city states
	- War was often the default relationship between them
## Colonization
- Probably because of land shortages
	- Greece has little arable land
- Key terms
	- *Metropolis*
		- = "Mother city"
		- Colonies were independent of the mother city
	- *Apoikia*
		- = "Colony"
	- *Oikistes*
		- = "Founder"
- People from all over the Greek world would come to Delphi to get approval to send out a community
- The earliest colonies were in Italy

## Literacy and Law
- The greeks rediscovered literacy
	- They used alphabet borrowed from the Phoenicians
- _Nomos_
	- = "law sanctioned by long usage", "customs"
- _Eunomia_
	- = "having good laws well obeyed", "lawfulness"
- _Agathoi_
	- = "good people" as they called themselves
	- A wealthy class that emerged in the dark ages
	- These people controlled the dispensation of justice, law-givers
		- They simply wrote down _nomos_ (customs)
			- The purpose of the laws was not to elevate the character of the community, but to simply codify the customs 
		- Story of every law-giver ends with either his death or departure, so that there wouldn't be a possibility of him changing the code
	- For example Solon and Cleisthenes were famous Athenian law-givers
## Economics
- A mercantile class arose in the first half of the 7th century BC
	- Coinage was introduced in about 680 BC
		- Coins became a part of civic identity
	- Aristocratic regimes of city states were often threatened by wealthy merchants ambitious for power
## Warfare
- Hoplites
	- The hoplite is a heavily armed soldier who is fighting in close formation

	- Phalanx is a rank of about 8 men
	- Battles were highly ritualized
		- Soldiers in line, they move towards each other until the _othimos_ (pushing) begins
		- The battles could last very long time
			- After the battle, the winning side would allow the losers generally to collect their wounded and dead
				- Then they'd set up a trophy and disperse
			- Almost no involvement of civilian population
- There were no professional armies, hoplites were essentially farmers
