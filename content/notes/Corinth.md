    -   Located at a good strategic place
- ## History
	- Artistocracy of the Bacchiads
    	- Only allowed marriage within the clan
    	- Corinth was very prosperous under them
        - They undertook many building projects
	- **Cypselus**, the first tyrant of Corinth
		- Ruled around ==655 – 625 BC==
		- Supposedly a son of a Bacchiad woman and an outsider
			- > According to Herodotus the Bacchiadae heard two prophecies from the Delphi oracle that the son of Eëtion would overthrow their dynasty, and they planned to kill the baby once it was born; however, Herodotus says that the newborn smiled at each of the men sent to kill it, and none of them could go through with the plan. An etiological myth-element, to account for the name Cypselus (cf. κυψέλη, __kypsele__, "chest") accounted how Labda then hid the baby in a chest, and when the men had composed themselves and returned to kill it, they could not find it.
	- Cypselus passed his rule onto his son, **Periander**
		- Ruled around ==625 – 585 BC==
		- Harsher ruler than his father 
		- Member of the *Seven Sages*
			- That is a title given by classical greek tradition to seven statesmen and law-givers of the 7th and 6th century BC
				- It included [[Milesian School#Thales|Thales]], Solon, Pittacus, Chilon, Cleobulus and Periander
