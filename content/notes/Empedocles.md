Born in Sicily around 492 BC he likes was influenced by [[Eleatics#Parmenides|Parmenides]] and [[Pythagoras]]. He seems to have been an active politician, who despite his aristocratic background supported democracy over olygarchy. He was also active as a philosopher and in medicine. He dressed very ostenatiously and is said to have claimed remarkable things about himself, e.g. that he is immortal. Eventually, he was exiled and went to Peloponnese, where he died. Diogenes Laertius wrote that desiring to demonstrate he was a god, he jumped into the crater of Mount Aetna.

Like Parmenides, Empedocles wrote in verse. He wrote at least two poems, *Physics* (about the cosmos) and *Purifications* (about ethics and religion).

Unlike Parmenides, Empedocles was a pluralist. He claimed that there are six eternal and unchanging entities. The roots (as he reffered to them): Earth, Water, Air and Fire. Two forces: Love and Strife. The roots are mixed and seperated by the forces. The cosmos also undergoes cycles of complete mixture and complete seperation. His system also includes *daimones*, which are some sort of divinites. They are not immortal like gods, but they are called "long-lived". Their destinies are determined by the lives their lead (which is where Empedocles' natural and religious views come together).

> But why do I insist on these matters as if I were accomplishing something great, if I am superior to mortal humans who perish many times? (Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 1.302)

> Blessed is he who possesses wealth of divine intelligence but wretched is he whose concern is a dim opinion about the gods. (Clement, *Miscellanies* 5.140)

> Narrow are the means of apprehension spread throughout the limbs. <br>
Many wretched things burst in which blunt the thoughts. <br>
People see a tiny part of life during their time <br>
and swift-fated they are taken away and fly like smoke, <br>
persuaded only of whatever each of them has chanced to meet <br>
as they were driven everywhere; but everyone boasts that he discovered the whole. <br>
These things are not in this way to be seen or heard by men <br>
or grasped with the mind. But you, since you have turned aside to this place, <br>
will learn; mortal cunning has reached no further. <br>
(Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 7.123)

>  I will tell you another thing. There is coming-to-be of not a single one of all <br>
mortal things, nor is there any end of destructive death, <br>
but only mixture, and separation of what is mixed, <br>
and nature (phusis) is the name given to them by humans. <br>
(Plutarch, *Against Colotes* 1111F–12A)

> If you fix them in your strong intelligence <br>
and gaze upon them propitiously with pure attention, <br>
these things will all be very much present to you all your life long, <br>
and from them you will obtain many others. For these very things <br>
grow into each kind of character, depending on each person’s nature. <br>
But if you reach out for other kinds of things, such as the millions <br>
of wretched things that are found among men that blunt their thoughts, <br>
indeed they will quickly leave you as time revolves, <br>
longing to come to their own dear kind. <br>
For know that all things possess thought and a portion of intelligence. <br>
(Hippolytus, *Refutation of All Heresies* 7.29.25)

> That which has to do with males came to be in the warmer part of the earth,and this is why men are dark and have stronger limbs and more hair.

(Galen, *Commentary on Hippocrates’ Epidemics* 6, 2.46)
