## Background

In the democratic classical [[Athens]], there was a great demand for teachers of rhethoric and other skills necessary for succesful public life the traditional education did not provide, and thus emerged the Sophists (from *sophos* meaning "wise") who provided these skills. They were not a unified school of thought, however we can see many common themes in their opinions, mainly skepticism and moral relativism. In fact, many Sophists were competing against each other for students (who usually came out of Athenian nobility).

Most of what we know about them comes from [[Plato]], who was definitely not impartial. In the dialogues, the Sophists are usually presented arguing with [[Socrates]], demonstrating the corrupt nature of the Sophists. This is why "sophist" has bad connotations today.

## Philosophers

### Protagoras
{{< img src="/notes/assets/protagoras-bust.webp" caption="Bust of Protagoras" >}}

Protagoras was born in Abdera, Thrace, in 490 BC. He died around 420 BC. He was well known everywhere in the Greek world, but he spent most of his time in Athens around [[Pericles]].

> A person is the measure of all things—of things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not. (Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 7.60)

> Concerning the gods I am unable to know either that they are or that they are not or what their appearance is like. For many are the things that hinder knowledge: the obscurity of the matter and the shortness of human life. (Eusebius, *Preparation of the Gospel* 14.3.7)

> Protagoras was the first to declare that there are two mutually opposed arguments on any subject. (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of the Philosophers* 9.51)

> This is making the weaker argument stronger. And people were rightly annoyed at Protagoras’ promise. (Aristotle, *Rhetoric* 2.24 1402a24–26)

### Gorgias

Born in Leontini, Sicily, in around 490 BC, Gorgias was a contemporary of Protagoras. Some reports say that he was over 100 years old when he died. He came to Athens on a diplomatic mission in 427 BC.

He's famous for two speeches, fragments of which survived:

1. *Defense of Helen of Troy* — A speech written to demonstrate the persuasive power of rhethorics. Read the short encomium [here](https://faculty.bemidjistate.edu/bdonovan/helen.html).
2. *On Nature, or, On What Is Not* — Perhaps a satirical response to Eleatic metaphysics. Read Sextus Empiricus' account of the speech [here](https://academic.mu.edu/taylorr/Ancient_Philosophy_Spring_2016/Gorgias_On_Nature.html).

### Hippias

Hippias was born in Elis, near Olympia in the Peloponnese. It is not known when he was born, but he was still around in the year of Socrates' death. Plato makes fun of him as a rather dim-witted polymath, but that's clearly a caricature. He taught rhethorics and mnemonics, but was also interested in mathematics and art. He was famous for his speeches at the Olympic games and his improvised speeches based on subjects proposed by the audience. He was also an early historiam. He compiled lists of Olympic victors and collected texts of poets and philosophers.

> Some of these things may have been said by Orpheus, some by Musaeus—in short, in different places by different authors—some by Hesiod, Homer, or other poets, and some in prose works by Greeks or foreigners. From all of them I [Hippias] have collected the most important ones that are related, and I will compose out of them this original and multiform account. (Clement of Alexandria, *Miscellanies* 6.2.15)

> How can anyone suppose that laws are a serious matter or believe in them, since it often happens that the very people who make them repeal them and substitute and pass others in their place? (Xenophon, *Memorabilia* 4.4.14)

### Antiphon

Antiphon was born somewhere in Attica (he was a citizen of Athens) around 480 BC. He had many philosophical interests, but he's known mainly for his views on justice, which he considers in relation between nature (*phusis*) and customs (*nomos*).

Fascinating polemic on justice by Antiphon from the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus (translation from my source, A Presocratic Reader):
> Justice is a matter of not transgressing what the nomoi prescribe in whatever city one is a citizen. A person would make most advantage of justice for himself if he treated the nomoi as important in the presence of witnesses and treated the decrees of *phusis* as important when alone and with no witnesses present. For the decrees of nomoi are extra additions, those of *phusis* are necessary; those of the nomoi are the products of agreement, not of natural growth, whereas those of *phusis* are the products of natural growth, not of agreement. (2) If those who made the agreement do not notice a person transgressing the prescriptions of nomoi, he is free from both disgrace and penalty, but not so if they do notice him. But if, contrary to possibility, anyone violates any of the things that are innate by *phusis*, the harm is no less if no one notices and no greater if all observe. For he does not suffer harm as a result of opinion but as a result of truth…<br>
This is the entire purpose of considering these matters—that most of the things that are just according to *nomos* are established in a way that is hostile to *phusis*. For nomoi have been established for the eyes as to what they must (3) see and what they must not, and for the ears as to what they must hear and what they must not, and for the tongue as to what it must say and what it must not, and for the hands as to what they must do and what they must not, and for the feet as to where they must go and where they must not, and for the mind as to what it must desire and what it must not. Now the things from which the nomoi deter humans are no more in accord with or suited to *phusis* than the things that they promote. <br>
Living and dying are matters of *phusis*, and living results for them from what is advantageous, dying from what is not advantageous. (4) But the advantages that are established by the nomoi are bonds on *phusis*, and those established by *phusis* are free. <br>
And so things that cause pain, at least when thought of correctly, do not help *phusis* more than things that give pleasure. Therefore it will not be painful things that are advantageous rather than pleasant things. For things that are truly advantageous must not cause harm but benefit. Now the things that are advantageous by *phusis* are among these…<br>
[But according to *nomos*, those are correct] who defend themselves after suffering (5) and are not first to do wrong, and those who do good to parents who are bad to them, and who permit others to accuse them on oath but do not themselves accuse on oath. You will find many of these cases hostile to *phusis*. They permit people to suffer more pain when less is possible and to have less pleasure when more is possible and to receive injury when it is not necessary.<br>
Now if some assistance came from the nomoi for those who submitted to these conditions and some damage to those who do not submit but resist, (6) obedience to the nomoi would not be unhelpful. But as things are, it is obvious that the justice that stems from *nomos* is insufficient to aid those who submit. In the first place, it permits the one who suffers to suffer and the wrongdoer to do wrong, and it was not at the time of the wrongdoing able to prevent either the sufferer from suffering or the wrongdoer from doing wrong. And when the case is brought to trial for punishment, there is no special advantage for the one who has suffered over the wrongdoer. For he must persuade the jury that he suffered and that he is able to exact the penalty. And it is open to the wrongdoer to deny it…. (7) However convincing the accusation is on behalf of the accuser, the defense can be just as convincing. For victory comes through speech.

Critias (the leading figure of the Thirty Tyrants in Athens) defends *nomos*:
> There was a time when human life was without order,
on the level of beasts, and subject to force; <br>
when there was no reward for the good <br>
or punishment for the bad. <br>
And then, I think, humans established <br>
nomoi as punishers, so that justice would be the mighty ruler <br>
of all equally and would have violence (hubris) as its slave, <br>
and anyone who did wrong would be punished. <br>
(Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 9.54)

Another great response to Antiphon is from anonymous text called *Anonymus Iamblichi*, which argues that *nomos* is grounded in *phusis*. I recommend reading it (you can message me and I'll send it to you if you can't find it).
