## Background

The Milesian School is considered to be the first school of thought of the ancient Greek philosophy. They were the first "naturalists" that broke away from the traditional theological approach to nature represented by [[Hesiod]] and others.

Instead of writing in verse (as was the practice before), Thales and his followers pioneered a form of prose, inquiries. (for example *Histories* of Herodotus is an inquiry) These inquiries were result of their work on a variety of subjects.

> Of those who first pursued philosophy, the majority believed that the only principles of all things are principles in the form of matter. For that of which all existing things are composed and that from which they originally come to be and that into which they finally perish—the substance persisting but changing in its attributes—this they state is the element and principle of the things that are…. For there must be one or more natures from which the rest come to be, while it is preserved. However, they do not all agree about how many or what kinds of such principles there are, but Thales, the founder of this kind of philosophy, stated it to be water. (This is why he declared that the earth rests on water.) He may have gotten this idea from seeing that the nourishment of all things is moist, and that even the hot itself comes to be from this and lives on this (the principle of all things is that from which they come to be)—getting this idea from this consideration and also because the seeds of all things have a moist nature; and water is the principle of the nature of moist things. (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 1.3)

## Philosophers
They were all from the city of Miletus in Ionia. Tradition reports that Thales was the teacher of Anaximander, who in turn taught Anaximenes.

### Thales

Thales was a member of the *Seven Sages* (a group of wise men in the [[Archaic Greece]]). He was probably born around 625 BC. (we know this from Greek chronicler Appolodorus who calculated birthdays by assuming a man was 40 at the time of his *acme*, the greatest achievement)

Beside being the *first philosopher*, he is also credited with discoveries in astronomy and geometry. In his account of the cosmos, Thales thought that the basic stuff was water and that the earth rests or floats on water.

> They say that once when Thales was gazing upwards while doing astronomy, he fell into a well, and that a witty and charming Thracian serving-girl made fun of him for being eager to know the things in the heavens but failing to notice what was just behind him and right by his feet. (Plato, *Theaetetus* 174a)

> The story goes that when they were reproaching him for his poverty, supposing that philosophy is useless, he learned from his astronomy that the olive crop would be large. Then, while it was still winter, he obtained a little money and made deposits on all the olive presses both in Miletus and in Chios, and since no one bid against him, he rented them cheaply. When the time came, suddenly many requested the presses all at once, and he rented them out on whatever terms he wished, and so he made a great deal of money. In this way he proved that philosophers can easily be wealthy if they wish, but this is not what they are interested in. (Aristotle, *Politics* 1.11)

> Some say the soul is mixed in with the whole universe, and perhaps this is why Thales supposed that all things are full of gods.
(Aristotle, *On the Soul* 1.5)

### Anaximander

Born around 610 BC (according to Diogenes Laertius), he was a student of Thales. He was credited with many achievements, such as constructing the first map of the world.

Anaximander sees the originating stuff of the cosmos as something indefinite (*apeiron*). This stuff is eternal and moving, thus it is directive of other things and eternal. The apeiron gives rise to something productive of hot and cold which in turn shapes the world. 

> Of those who declared that the arkhē (= *the originating principle*) is one, moving and apeiron, Anaximander … said that the apeiron was the arkhē and element of things that are, and he was the first to introduce this name for the arkhē [that is, he was the first to call the arkhē apeiron]. (In addition he said that motion is eternal, in which it occurs that the heavens come to be.) He says that the arkhē is neither water nor any of the other things called elements, but some other nature which is apeiron, out of which come to be all the heavens and the worlds in them. The things that are perish into the things from which they come to be, according to necessity, for they pay penalty and retribution to each other for their injustice in accordance with the ordering of time, as he says in rather poetical language. (Simplicius, *Commentary on Aristotle’s Physics* 24.13–21)

> Some, like Anaximander … declare that the earth stays at rest because of equality. For it is no more fitting for what is situated at the center and is equally far from the extremes to move up rather than down or sideways. And it is impossible for it to move in opposite directions at the same time. Therefore, it stays at rest of necessity. (Aristotle, *On the Heavens* 2.13 295b11–16)

> Anaximander … believed that there arose from heated water and earth either fish or animals very like fish. In these, humans grew and were kept inside as embryos up to puberty. Then finally they burst, and men and women came forth already able to nourish themselves. (Censorinus, On the Day of Birth 4.7)

### Anaximenes

Born around 585 BC, he was a student of Anaximander. Like Thales, he agreed that there is one original stuff, but he thought it was aēr (usually translated as air, but this was less transparent). He explicitly mentions condensation and rarefaction as the process that transforms aēr and the other stuff of the cosmos.

Like other Presocratics, he also gave explanations for natural phenomena.

> Anaximenes … like Anaximander, declares that the underlying nature is one and unlimited [apeiron] but not indeterminate, as Anaximander held, but definite, saying that it is air. It differs in rarity and density according to the substances \<it becomes\>. Becoming finer, it comes to be fire; being condensed, it comes to be wind, then cloud; and when still further condensed, it becomes water, then earth, then stones, and the rest come to be from these. He too makes motion eternal and says that change also comes to be through it. (Theophrastus, quoted by Simplicius, *Commentaryon* Aristotle’s *Physics* 24.26–25.)

> Anaximenes determined that air is a god and that it comes to be and is without measure, infinite, and always in motion. (Cicero, *On the Nature of the Gods* 1.10.26)

> Anaximenes declares that when the earth is being drenched and dried out it bursts, and earthquakes result from these hills breaking off and collapsing. This is why earthquakes occur in droughts and also in heavy rains. For in the droughts, as was said, the earth is broken while being dried out, and when it becomes excessively wet from the waters, it falls apart. (Aristotle, *Meteorology* 2.7)
