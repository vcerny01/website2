- War between the [[Athens#Delian League|Delian League]] led by Athens and the [[Sparta#Peloponnesian League|Peloponnesian League]] led by Sparta
- ==431–404 BC==
### Thirty Year's Peace
- A treaty signed between Athens and Sparta in ==446 BC== that brought an end to the conflict known as the 'First Peloponnesian War'
	- That was a series of occasional battles raging from ==460 BC==
- The peace was first tested when the powerful Athenian ally Samos rebelled against the alliance (==440 BC==)
	- The Spartans called a congress of their allies whether to engage in war with Athens
		- The Corinthians were against the intervention so the council voted against war with Athens
	- The revolt was crushed and peace maintained
### Outbreak of War
- ==433–431 BC==
- Outbreak of war between Athens and [[Corinth]]
	- A conflict arises between Corinth and its colony Corsyra
		- There were negotians, finally Athenians decided to take the side of Corsyra
			- To uphold the peace, the small fleet Athenians sent didn't intervene in the battle of Sybota
	- Following this, another conflict arises with a Corinthian colony of Potadia that is a tribute paying member of the Delian League
		- Athenians order the Potedians to tear down their walls, send hostages to Athens and dismiss all Corinthian magistrates from the city
			- But Potadians decline and appeal to their mother city, Corinth
		- During the following battle of Potidaea, Corinth unoficially aided the city by sneaking contigents of men into the besieged city to help defend it
			- This was a direct violation of the peace treaty
	- Megara (a polis located between Athens and Corinth) decides to get involved on the Corinthian side
		- Athens responds with the Megarian Decree
			- Total embargo, economic warfare
	- Eventually, at the meeting in Sparta, Corinthians persuade Sparta to start war against Athens
		- To persuade them, they compared the Spartan and Athenian national characters and described Spartans as too afraid to do anything
	- Almost entire greek world joins the war afterwards

### Athenian Strategy
- [[Pericles]] realized Athens didn't stand a chance against the Sparta in the traditional hoplite warfare
	- So he moved Athenians off the land into a protected enclave of the long walls
	- As long as they have the fleet providing Athens with supplies and raid the Spartan coast, they would be fine
- At the end of first year of the war, Pericles delivers his famous [funeral oration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles%27_Funeral_Oration)
- Shortly after this address, a **plague** broke out in Athens
	- Probably arrived by ship
	- Some kind of bubonic plague
	- It is estimated as much as a third of Athenian population died
	- Under the pressure of the plague, many laws collapsed
	- Athenians responded by taking it out on Pericles
		- In a long time, after 17 years, Pericles was not elected general
			- But they changed their minds quickly after
		- Pericles delivers his so-called [last speech](http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/thuc-sp.html)
			- He catches the plague and dies in ==429 BC==
### Cleon and Brasidas
- Revolt of Mytilene against Athens (the island of Lesbos) (==428–427 BC==)
	- Athenians crushed the revolt and voted on the ultimate penalty
		- That is all men will be killed, women and children will be sold into slavery
	- After debate between Cleon (for the penalty) and Diodotus (against the penalty), the penalty is not exercised, but things are getting more and more tense in Athens
- Stasis (civil war) in Corcyra (==427 BC==)
	- Begins with killing an official Athenian friend there
- Cleon's victory at Pylos/Sphacteria against Spartans (==425 BC==)
	- Cleon has become very influential in Athens afterwards
- There is a shortage of manpower in Sparta (helots and others get into battles as well)
- New Spartan general Brasidas launches a fast campaign north of Athens
	- Wins at Amphipolis (==424 BC==)
		- The battle was led by Thucydides who is in response to this event exiled from Athens
	- In response to that, Cleon is appointed general and goes north to Brasidas
		- 422 BC - There's large battle, Athenians lose (600 of them are killed including Cleon), on Spartan they are only seven fatalities reported, but one of them was Brasidas
### Peace of Nicias
- ==421 BC==
- Signed between both sides
- Mutual non-agression is to last for 50 years
	- Disputes are to be solved by arbitration rather than conflict
- The situation was still tense on many fronts
	- Sparta tried to get Corinth ally with Thebes against Athens
	- Athenian general Alcibades got the Peloponnesian states of Ellis and Mantineia to ally with Argos against Spart (==420 BC==)
		- Combined forces of these three states are defeated at at Argives (==418 BC==)
### Siege of Melos
- ==416 BC==
- Athenians go to the island of Melos and demand that they join the Delian League as subordinate tribute paying allies
	- Melos refuses to
	- Siege is led by **[[Alcibiades]]**
- Famous [Melian dialogue](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/melian.htm)
	 - Athenians give Melians a choice: either they become a tribute-paying members or they will be destroyed
- The Melians decide to resist
	- Athenians come back with a massive fleet
	- After a short siege, Athenians kill almost all adult males (few manage to escape into slavery) and sell women and children into slavery
		- Then they resettle the island with 500 colonists from Athens
### The Sicilian Expedition
- ==416–413 BC==
- Athenians decide to invade Sicily
	- An Athenian ally, Segesta, got into quarrel with nearby state of Selinus and asked Athenians for help
		- **Nicias** (the general who signed the peace of Nicias), anti-war, and [[Alcibiades]], pro-war, debate the issue
			- Alcibiades was more persuasive, although Niccius' arguments were more rational
- Shortly before their arrival, Alcibiades hears that the Athenians have sent a ship out with orders that he be arrested
	- So he flees to Sparta
		- He gives them invaluable advice to make advances on Athens (as the home defenses were way down at the time)
			- Spartans establish a fort at Dekelea in the Attic territory
- At first, Athenians have some successes
- Athenians start beseiging Syracuse (the only Spartan colony)
	- Syracusans build a number of counter-walls
	- During these small fights, Lamachus is killed and only Nicias remains from the original 3 generals
- Sparta sends help under general Gylippus
	- They began to make a counter-wall, making the Athenian wall useless
	- The Corinthian fleet under the command of Erasinides also arrives
- Nicias, exhausted from illness, sends a letter to Athens, hoping they would recall him
	- Instead of recalling the expedition, Athenians send out massive reinforcments under general Demosthenes and Eurymedon
	- Still they were losing
- As Athenians were preparing to sail home, there was a lunar eclipse and Nicias, as a particularly superstitous man, decided to wait for another 27 days because of it
	- Syracusans took advantage of this and attacked Athenian ships in the harbor (76 vs. 86)
		- Athenians were defeated, Eurymedon killed
- Eventually, Athenians were trapped and exterminated
	- Either killed or sold into slavery
### The Sicilian Expedition Aftermath
- There was a series of revolts among in the Delian League
- Board of 10 *probouloi* was established
	- Sort of like a super executive comitee
	- Highly trusted men of upstanding character
		- Still a breach in the democratic process
- #### The Oligarchic Revolution
	- ==411 BC==
	- Membership in assembly restricted to 5K wealthiest citizens
	- A super council of 400 is established
	- This oligarchy slowly fades away, though, and democracy is restored
### The Treaty of Miletus
- ==412 BC==
- Alcibiades had to leave Sparta for Persia
	- He led negotiations with Persians to lend money to build Spartan fleet (which was an oxymoron for most Spartans)
	- He seduced the wife of one of the Spartan kings
- But Spartans continued the negotiations and came up with a treaty
	- In return for money, they would no longer oppose Persian attempts to control the Ionian states
		- Just like that the focus of the war shifts up norteast, because there was a crucial supply line for the Athenians
### Alcibiades returns to Athens
- ==408 BC==
- Spartans are defeated in two battles northeast
	- One of them is the battle of Cyzicus
		- The Spartans offered peace, Athenians declined it
		- Alcibiades joins the pro-Athenian side
			- Back in Athens, he was cleared of all charges of impiety and was made a "commander-in-chief"
			- But after a while, Athenian public opinion shifted, he fled Athens and never returned again
### Battle of Arginusae
- ==406 BC==
- Battle of Athenian and Spartan fleets
	- Sparta lost
- A storm came afterwards, so Athenians failed to pick up their dead
	- Back in Athens a motion is proposed that the generals be tried for this as a group
		- That is a completely illegal practice
		- The vote was eventually carried out and six generals were executed (among them one of the sons of Pericles)
### Battle of Aegospotami
- ==406 BC==
- The Spartan fleet is under command of a very capable general named [[Lysander]]
- Athenians were in very vulnerable position
- Spartans had a decisive victory
	- 160 out of 180 Athenian ships were destroyed and several thousands killed
		- Athenian navy is now effectively destroyed
### Athens Surrender
- ==404 BC==
- Athens was surrounded and starved into submission
	- Some Athenian enemies, notably Corinth and Thebes wanted Athens to be treated like Athens treated Melos
		- But Spartans resisted
	- The long walls and Athenian city walls were torn down
- Athenians were free but reduced to Athens and the island of Salamis
	- Their fleet was reduced to 12 ships
- In the places of former Athenian allies, Spartans imposed decharcies
	- A board of ten to control a state
- In Athens, they imposed an [[Athens#Thirty Tyrants (404–403 BC)|oligarchy of thirty]]

After the war Spartans enjoyed a brief period of hegemony.
