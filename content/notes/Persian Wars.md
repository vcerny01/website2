    - They were led by Aristagoras, the tyrant of Miletus
        - He asks [[Sparta]] and [[Athens]] to help him Spartans declined, but Athens came to help
            - Probably because former Athenian tyrant Hippias was exiled in Persia and seemed to be planning his return to power
            - Athens mustered a fleet of 20 ships supplemented by 4 additional ships from from another polis called Eretria
                - The revolt spread after the [battle of Sardis](http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_sardis_498.html) (==498 BC==) (important persian outpost)
    - In ==494 BC==, the revolt was finally crushed
        - Miletus was sacked and burned as a revenge for the destruction of Sardis 
- After the revolt, Persians went demanding earth and water as a symbol of surrendering
    - Sacrilige in Athens and Sparta
        - When the convoy came to Athens, they were killed
        - When the convoy came to Sparta, the Spartans threw them into a well and told them to get their own earth and water
