## Background

Eleatics were one of the principal schools of thought in ancient Greece. They were based in the Greek colony Elea (in southern Italy). 

## Philosophers
As with [[Milesians]], they consist of 3 subsequent philosophers (Xenophanes taught Parmenides, Parmenides taught Zeno).

### Xenophanes

{{< img src="https://iep.utm.edu/wp-content/media/xenophanes-219x300.jpg" >}}

Xenophanes was born in Colophon (now on the western coast of Turkey) around 570 BC, he left the city after it fell to the Persians in 546 BC. Xenophanes was both a poet and a philosopher, he wrote in verse.

Besides typical poetic topics, Xenophanes addressed theological question. He rejected the traditional view of Olympian gods (such as are found in Homer or Hesiod), divination and theological significance of natural phenomena. Instead, he proposed that there is a supreme non-antropomorphic god, who controls the universe by thought. In rejecting theologically-backed knowledge of the natural world, he claimed humans must discover the laws of nature by themselves, via inquiry.

He also had keen interest in the natural world. He wrote about fossils of sea creatures, developed a a complicated "cloud astrophysics", etc. Overall, his opinions were rather radical even for a poet, e.g., he lamented over-glorification of athletes.

> Once he passed by as a puppy was being beaten, the story goes, and in pity said these words: <br>
“Stop, do not beat him, since it is the soul of a man, a friend of mine, which I recognized when I heard it crying.” (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of the Philosophers* 8.36)

> Already there are sixty-seven years <br>
tossing my speculation throughout the land of Greece, <br>
and from my birth there were twenty-five in addition to these, <br>
if indeed I know how to speak truly about these matters. (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of the Philosophers* 9.19)

>  If horses had hands, or oxen or lions, <br>
or if they could draw with their hands and produce works as men do, <br>
then horses would draw figures of gods like horses, and oxen like oxen, <br>
and each would render the bodies <br>
to be of the same frame that each of them have. (Clement, *Miscellanies* 5.110)

> Xenophanes used to say that those who say that the gods are born are just as impious as those who say that they die, since either way it follows that there is a time when the gods do not exist. (Aristotle, *Rhetoric* 2.23)

> He says that the sun is gathered together from many small fires…. He declares that the earth is without limit and is not surrounded by air in every direction, that all things come into being from the earth. And he says that sun and stars come into being from the clouds. (Pseudo-Plutarch, *Miscellanies* 4)

### Parmenides

Parmenides was born in Elea (today an Italian town called Velia) around 515 BC. He was a student of Xenophanes, but didn't adopt his views. Like Xenophanes, he wrote in verse.

According to Diogenes Laertius, Parmenides composed only a single work, a metaphysical poem, in the traditional epic medium of the hexameter verse. He is credited as the "Father of Metaphysics".

Only a limited number of fragments of the poem has survived. These have been traditionally assigned into three main sections: *Proem*, *Truth* (Aléthia) and *Opinion* (Doxa). The Proem introduces a young man (kuruous in Greek) taken on a spiritual journey to a Greek godess who shall reveal to him the nature of reality.

In the next part, Truth, the queen introduces three ways of inquiry. The first is the *way of Conviction* that "attends truth" and is based on "what-is". The second way inquiry is of "what-is-not" and it is dismissed right away since "what-is-not" is literally unthinkable. The third way, the "way of Mortals", doesn't lead to knowledge as it draws conclusions based on experience for which there is no true reliance, thus they allow that "it is and is not" is true of things.

Finally, in the third part, Parmenides explores the features of genuine being ("what-is"): it must be one, whole, complete and unchanging.

What does this all mean? Basically, Parmenides reasons his way to absolute monism. He makes a point against inquiries of previous philosophers, who thought things could go in and out of existence (or tranform into other things). He is convinced that these beliefs are based on "habit born of much experience" and experience is misleading. Instead, to attain true knowledge of things, we need to think abstractly and use our capacity to reason.

> The mares which carry me as far as my spirit ever aspired <br>
were escorting me, when they brought me and proceeded along the renowned route <br>
of the goddess, which brings a knowing mortal to all cities one by one. <br>
On this route I was being brought, on it wise mares were bringing me, <br>
[5] straining the chariot, and maidens were guiding the way. <br>
The axle in the center of the wheel was shrilling forth the bright sound of a musical pipe, <br>
ablaze, for it was being driven forward by two rounded <br>
wheels at either end, as the daughters of the Sun <br>
were hastening to escort [me] after leaving the house of Night <br>
[10] for the light, having pushed back the veils from their heads with their hands. <br>
There are the gates of the roads of Night and Day, <br>
and a lintel and a stone threshold contain them. <br>
High in the sky they are filled by huge doors <br>
of which avenging Justice holds the keys that fit them. <br>
[15] The maidens beguiled her with soft words <br>
and skillfully persuaded her to push back the bar for them <br>
quickly from the gates. They made <br>
a gaping gap of the doors when they opened them, <br>
swinging in turn in their sockets the bronze posts <br>
[20] fastened with bolts and rivets. There, straight through them then, <br>
the maidens held the chariot and horses on the broad road. <br>
And the goddess received me kindly, took my <br>
right hand in hers, and addressed me with these words: <br>
Young man, accompanied by immortal charioteers <br>
[25] who reach my house by the horses which bring you, <br>
welcome—since it was not an evil destiny that sent you forth to travel <br>
this route (for indeed it is far from the beaten path of humans), <br>
but Right and Justice. It is right that you learn all things— <br>
both the unshaken heart of well-persuasive Truth <br>
[30] and the beliefs of mortals, in which there is no true trust. <br>
But nevertheless you will learn these too—how it were right that the things that seem <br>
be reliably, being indeed, the whole of things. <br>
(Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians*
7.111–14)

> In this way, according to opinion (doxa), these things have grown and now are and afterwards after growing up will come to an end. And upon them humans have established a name to mark each one. (Simplicius, *Commentary on Aristotle’s On the Heavens* 558.9–11)

### Zeno of Elea

{{< img src="/notes/assets/zeno-of-elea.webp" >}}

The most of what we know about Zeno's life comes from Plato's dialogue *Parmenides*. He was probably born around 490 BC. (Plato claims he was 25 years younger than Parmenides) Also, according to Plato, Zeno and Parmenides visited Athens in about 450 BC and met young Socrates. Zeno mostly explored consequences of Parmenides' teaching via thought experiments.

> If it is, each thing must have some size and thickness, and part of it must be apart from the rest. And the same reasoning holds concerning the part that is in front. For that too will have size, and part of it will be in front. Now to say this once is the same thing as to keep saying it forever. For no such part of it will be the last or unrelated to another. Therefore if there are many things, they must be both small and large; so small as not to have size, but so large as to be infinite. (Simplicius, *Commentary on Aristotle’s Physics* 141.2–8)

> Once Parmenides and Zeno came to Athens for the Great Panathenaic festival. Parmenides was quite an elderly man, very gray, but fine and noble in appearance, just about sixty-five years old. Zeno was then almost forty, of a good height and handsome to see. The story goes that he had been Parmenides’ young lover…. Socrates and many others were eager to listen to Zeno’s treatise, for he had then brought it to Athens for the first time. Socrates was then very young. Zeno himself read it to them…. When Socrates had heard it, he asked Zeno to read again the first hypothesis of the first argument. When he had read it, he said, “How do you mean this, Zeno? If things that are are many, they must therefore be both like and unlike, but this is impossible. For unlike things cannot be like, nor can like things be unlike. Isn’t that what you are saying?”<br>
&emsp; *Zeno*: Yes <br>
&emsp; *Socrates*: Now if it is impossible for unlike things to be like and for like things to be unlike, is it also impossible for things to be many? For if they were many they would have impossible attributes. Is this the point of your arguments—to contend, against all that is said, that things are not many? And do you think that each of your arguments proves this? <br>
&emsp; *Zeno*: You have well understood the purpose of the whole work. <br>
&emsp; *Socrates*: I understand, Parmenides, that Zeno here wants to be identified with you by his treatise as well as his friendship, for he has written somewhat in the same style as you, but by changing it he is trying to make us think he is saying something else. For in your poem you declare that the all is one and you do a good job of proving this, while he declares that it is not many, and furnishes many impressive proofs. Now when one of you says it is one and the other that it is not many, and each speaks so as to seem not to have said any of the same things, though you are saying practically the same things, what you have said appears beyond the rest of us. <br>
&emsp; *Zeno*: Yes, Socrates, but you have not completely understood the truth of the treatise…. It is actually a defense of Parmenides’ argument against those who try to make fun of it, saying that if what-is is one, the argument has many ridiculous consequences which contradict it. Now my treatise opposes the advocates of plurality and pays them back the same and more, aiming to prove that their hypothesis, “if there are many things,” suffers still more ridiculous consequences than the hypothesis that there is one, if anyone follows it through sufficiently. I wrote it in this spirit of competitiveness when I was young, and then someone stole it, so I did not even have the chance to consider whether it should be made public. (Plato, *Parmenides* 127b–128d)

Aristotle describes the most famous of Zeno's arguments in *Physics* 6.9 (later in the book he proceeds to show logical flaws in them):

> Zeno’s arguments about motion, which cause so much trouble to those who try to answer
them, are four in number. The first asserts the non-existence of motion on the ground that that which is in locomotion
must arrive at the half-way stage before it arrives at the goal [...] <br>

{{< img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Zeno_Achilles_Paradox.png" caption="The Achilles problem" >}}

> The second is the so-called Achilles, and it amounts to this, that in a race the quickest runner can never overtake the slowest, since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead. This argument is the same in principle as that which depends on bisection, though it differs from it in that the spaces with which we have successively to deal are not divided into halves. The result of the argument is that the slower is not overtaken; but it proceeds along the same lines as the bisection- argument (for in both a division of the space in a certain way leads to the result that the goal is not reached, though the Achilles goes further in that it affirms that even the runner most famed for his speed must fail in his pursuit of the slowest), so that the solution too must be the same. And the claim that that which holds a lead is never overtaken is false: it is not overtaken while it holds a lead; but it is overtaken nevertheless if it is granted that it traverses the finite distance. These then are two of his arguments.

> The third is that already given above, to the effect that the flying arrow is at rest, which resultfollows from the assumption that time is composed of moments: if this assumption is not granted, the conclusion will not follow.

{{< img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hVR76.png" caption="The stadium paradox, which goes against the notion of absolute discrete space" >}}

> The fourth argument is that concerning equal bodies which move alongside equal bodies in the stadium from opposite directions—the ones from the end of the stadium, the others from the middle—at equal speeds, in which he thinks it follows that half the time is equal to its double. The fallacy consists in requiring that a body travelling at an equal speed travels for an equal time past a moving body and a body of the same size at rest. That is false. E.g. let the stationary equal bodies be AA; let BB be those starting from the middle of the A’s (equal in number and in magnitude to them); and let CC be those starting from the end (equal in number and magnitude to them, and equal in speed to the B’s). Now it follows that the first B and the first C are at the end at the same time, as they are moving past one another. And it follows that the C has passed all the A’s and the B half; so that the time is half, for each of the two is alongside each for an equal time. And at the same time it follows that the first B has passed all the C’s. For at the same time the first B and the first C will be at opposite ends, being an equal time alongside each of the B’s as alongside each of the A’s, as he says, because both are an equal time alongside the A’s.
