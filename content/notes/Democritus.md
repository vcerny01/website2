Democritus and Leucippus are traditionally grouped together, because Democritus was Leucipuss' student and it's not really sure what ideas are originally from Leucippus and what from Democritus.

There's not much known about Leucipuss, except that he was was born somewhere around Miletus and developed his atomic system sometime around 440 BC. He was a contemporary of other post-Eleatic philosophers, such as Empedocles. Two books are attributed to him: *On Mind* and *The Great World System (Makrokosmos)*.

Democritus was born somewhere around 460 BC in Abdera (in Thrace). It is said he lived for about 100 years and thus became a contemporary of Socrates and Plato. There are more than 70 titles attributed to Democritus. He wrote on various subjects: philosophy, medicine, warfare, painting, etc.

The two philosophers are best known for devoloping the metaphysical theory of atomism, which was later a major competitor to teleological system of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. At the core of the atomic system is obviously the atom (*atomos* in means "uncuttable" Greeek). The atomists claimed there is an indefinite number of atoms, each of which is uniform and unchangeable in any way, except position. Atoms differ from each other only in shape and size. [[Parmenides|Parmenidean]] requirements for reality are met so far. But there's also void (the empty) in which atoms move, which challenges this Parmenidean perception of reality.

What looks like change is merely rearrangment of these two basic entities. According to Democritus, everything besides atoms and void is only by convention.

> No thing happens at random but all things as a result of a reason and by necessity (Aëtius 1.25.4)

> Leucippus’ opinion is this: All things are unlimited and they all turn around one another; the all [the universe] is both the empty [void] and the full. The worlds come to be when the atoms fall into the void and are entangled with one another. The nature of the stars comes to be from their motion, and from their increase [in entanglements]. The sun is carried around in a larger circle around the moon; and whirled around the center, the earth rides steady; its shape is drumlike. He was the first to make the atoms first principles. (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of the Philosophers* 9.30)

> After establishing the shapes, Democritus and Leucippus base their account of alteration and coming-to-be on them: coming-to-be and perishing by means of separation and combination, alteration by means of arrangement and position. Since they held that the truth is in the appearance, and appearances are opposite and infinite, they made the shapes infinite, so that by reason of changes of the composite, the same thing seems opposite to different people, and it shifts position when a small additional amount is mixed in, and it appears completely different when a single thing shifts position. For tragedy and comedy come to be out of the same letters. (Aristotle, *On Generation and Corruption* 1.1 315b6–15)

> Since the bodies differ in shape, and the shapes are infinite, they declare the simple bodies to be infinite too. But they did not determine further what is the shape of each of the elements, beyond assigning a spherical shape to fire. They distinguished air and water and the others by largeness and smallness. (Aristotle, *On the Heavens* 3.4 303a11–15)

>  When Democritus said that the atoms are in contact with each other, he did not mean contact, strictly speaking, which occurs when the surfaces of the things in contact fit perfectly with one another, but the condition in which the atoms are near one another and not far apart is what he called contact. For no matter what, they are separated by void. (Philoponus, *Commentary on Aristotle’s On Generation and Corruption* 158.27–159.3)

> For they say that there is always motion. But why it is and what motion it is, they do not state, nor do they give the cause of its being of one sort rather than another. (Aristotle, *Metaphysics* 12.6 1071b33–35)

> Democritus holds that there is one kind of motion, that due to pulsation. (Aëtius 1.23.3)

> Democritus leaves aside purpose but refers all things which nature employs to necessity. (Aristotle, *Generation of Animals* 5.8 789b2–4)

> Animals flock together with animals of the same kind—doves with doves, cranes with cranes, and likewise for the other irrational kinds. It is the same for inanimate things, as can be seen in the cases of seeds being sifted and pebbles on the shore. For through the swirling and separating motion of the sieve, lentils wind up together with lentils, wheat with wheat, and barley with barley, and through the motion of the waves, elongated pebbles are pushed to the same place as other elongated ones, and round ones to the same place as round ones, as if the similarity in these had some mutually attractive force for things. (Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 7.116)

> There are an infinite number of kosmoi of different sizes. In some there is no sun or moon. In some the sun and moon are larger than ours, and in others there are more. The distances between the kosmoi are unequal, and in one region there are more, in another fewer. Some are growing, some are at their peak, and some are declining, and here one is coming into being, there one is ceasing to be. They perish when they collide with one another. Some kosmoi have no animals, plants, or any moisture. In our own kosmos the earth came into being before the stars. The moon is lowest, then the sun, then the fixed stars. The planets too have unequal heights. A kosmos is at its peak until it is no longer able to take anything in from outside. (Hippolytus, *Refutation of All Heresies* 1.13.2–4)

> By convention, sweet; by convention, bitter; by convention, hot; by convention, cold; by convention, color; but in reality, atoms and void. (Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 7.135)

> Nonetheless [Democritus] is found condemning them [the senses]. For he says, “We in fact understand nothing exactly [or, “exact”], but what changes according to the disposition both of the body and of the things that enter it and offer resistance to it.” (Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 7.136)

>  In reality we know nothing about anything, but for each person opinion is a reshaping [of the soul-atoms by the atoms entering from without]. (Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 7.136)

> In reality we know nothing, for truth is in the depths. (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of the Philosophers* 9.72)

> Democritus says that certain images of atoms approach humans, and of them some cause good and others evil, and as a result he prayed “to meet with propitious images.” These are large and immense, and difficult to destroy though not indestructible. They indicate the future in advance to people when they are seen and emit voices. As a result people of ancient times, upon perceiving the appearances of these things, supposed that they are a god, though there is no other god aside from these having an indestructible nature. (Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 9.19)

> The goal of life is cheerfulness, which is not the same as pleasure … but the state in which the soul continues calmly and stably, disturbed by no fear or superstition or any other emotion. He also calls it “well-being” and many other names. (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of the Philosophers* 9.45)

> Accept nothing pleasant unless it is beneficial. (Democrates, *Maxims*)

> To all humans the same thing is good and true, but different people find different things pleasant. (Democrates, *Maxims*)
