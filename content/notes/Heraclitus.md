Little is known about his life. According to Diogener Laertius, Heraclitus of Ephesus (a city in Ionia) was born around 540 BC. He was from an aristocratic family, but he ceded his hereditary ruling position to his brother. His reputatition was that of misanthropy, anti-intellectualism and obscurity. He was also strongly against alcohol and for self-moderation. He also recommends the conventional Greek goal of seeking fame.

He is said to have written a single book, which he deposited in the great temple of Artemis at Ephesus. He is seen independent of major philosophical schools of his time (implying he was probably self-taught), although he might have been influenced by [[Xenophanes]]. All in all, he did his best to break from other philosophical traditions of his time, rejecting polymathy, because it "does not teach understanding". His writing is at times intentionally very ambigous as he stretched the Greek language to make multiple points at the same time.

At the core of Heraclitus' cosmology is the *logos*, a divine law that controls the universe. The words *logos* has many meanings, e.g., "account", "things said" or "word". While *logos* is the single objective truth, Heraclitus holds that most people do not have the capacity to understand it.

The physical sign of the *logos* is fire, because it's always changing, yet always the same. The unity of opposites and constant change are other hallmarks of his philosophy. According to Heraclitus, contrary qualities can be found everywhere and everalsting change is the result of strife between the opposites. In the end, his philosophy could be classified as monist.

For Heraclitus, I decided to include a lot of fragments. For one, because they're interesting, but also because they can be of help in understanding the roots of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s philosophy.

> Although this *logos* holds always humans prove unable to understand it both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For although all things come to be in accordance with this *logos*, humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each thing in accordance with its nature (*physis*) and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep. For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the logos is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding. (Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 7.132, 7.133)

> An unapparent connection (*harmonia*) is stronger than an apparent one. (Hippolytus, *Refutation of All Heresies* 9.9.5)

> We step into and we do not step into the same rivers. We are and we are not. (Heraclitus Homericus, *Homeric Questions* 24)

> The road up and the road down are one and the same. (Hippolytus, *Refutation of All Heresies* 9.10.4)

> Disease makes health pleasant and good, hunger satiety, weariness rest. (Stobaeus, *Selections* 3.1.178)

>  This kosmos, the same for all, none of gods nor humans made, but it was always and is and shall be: an ever-living fire, kindled in measures and extinguished in measures. (Clement, *Miscellanies* 5.103.3)
