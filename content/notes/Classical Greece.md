## Tragedy and Comedy
-  Not just entertainment, very important for political, culture and civic life (especially in Athens)
-  Always somehow connected to the god Dionysus
-  Seems to have evolved from choral competitions
-  During the golden age of Athens
	-  Two great festivals
		-  *Lenaia*
			-  In late winter
			-  Primarily for comedy
		-  *Dionysia*
			-  In spring
			-  Primarily for tragedy
	- Each year, the eponymous Archon would choose 3 poets who were assigned to compete in the tragic festivals
		- He would then select 3 wealthy citizens (*choregoi*) that would act as a sort of producers to defray the expenses
- Ampitheaters
	- Plan

	- Its capacity was about 15,000
	- Great acoustics
	- All actors were male
	- Actors had masks
		- So that they could be identifiable at long distance
	- All chorus members were male
- Comedy
	- The surviving body of 5th century BC Greek comedy is very small
	- The only comedies that have survived are written by Aristophanes
	- In comparison to tragedy, they used contemporary life rather than myth as their theme
		- Moreover, the comic hero is an ordinary person
	- Standard comedy structure
		- The hero gets an idea
		- Thriumps over opposition to it
		- Enjoys the fruits of his wonderful idea
## Symposium
- It means "drinking together"
- Ritualized event for citizens
	  - Invited guests reclined on couches around the edge of the room
- In the center there was a great mixing bowl called *krater* in which water and wine were mixed together and served to participants
- There was *symposiarch*
	- He was in charge of keeping things, progressing, orderly, etc.
	- Usually the host of the event
	- Music was played during the event
- Because there was food and drink, god Dionysus was the presiding divinity there

## Women in ancient Greece
- Most of our sources come from [[Athens]]
- The law was that a woman of any age had to have an adult male guardian (*Kyrios*)
	- For a girl, that would be her father, for young woman, that would be her husband and if either father or husban died, she would pass to any number of her male relatives
- They could testify at trials, but, they could not, for example, own property (as women could not be citizens)
- Marriage
	- They got married in their early teens to a man very much older (in his late 20s, early 30s)
	- Marriages were arrange by the *Kyrios* who came to an agreement with the groom
	- Wedding processions generally took place at night
	- Divorce was possible
- Women were responsible for managing the household
	- Taking care of children and slaves
	- Taking care of goods, particularly cloth
- There was a courtesan class of women (*hetaire*)
- Women were very important in religion
	- Many goddesses in myths
	- The priestess at athens, the prophet of Apollo at Delphi
	- Women's only religious festivals
		- The most famous one was called the *Thesmophoria*
## Foreigners and Slaves in Athens
- Population estimates for [[Athens]]
  |          | 480 BC   | 432 BC      |
	| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
	| Citizens | 25–30K   | 35–45K      |
	| Metics   | 4–5K     | 10–15K      |
	| Slaves   | 30–40K   | 80–100K     |
	| Total    | 125–150K | 215K – 300K |
- Ancient Greeks had a rather ambivalent attitude toward work
- #### Foreigners
	- Some terms
		- *Metic*
			- From *met*-*oikos* - "one who has changed his home"
			- Resident foreigner
		- *Metoikon*
			- A special tax paid by a metic
		- *Prostates*
			- Citizen sponsor for a metic
	- If they were there only for a short time, they were just visitors, but longer they gained the metic status and had to pay metoikon
	- Rights
		- They had some legal protection
		- They had to perform military service when called on
		- They had no political rights
		- They could not own land in Attica
		- They could not intermarry
	- They were mostly drawn to Athens because of money and opportunities
	- Metics could be and were very important and wealthy
		- E.g. [Lysias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysias)
- #### Slaves
	- There's a variety of unfree labor
		- Helots
		- Serfs
			- Peasant farmers
		- Chattel slavery
			- One person owns another
			- Present in all greek communities
				- The primary source of slaves
		- Debt bondage
	- After Solon's reforms, slaves were necessarily foreigners
		- So they were atomized and had no "slave consciousness"
			- So they never revolted
	- They worked in agriculture and in workshops too
		- They were a part of the household, they could even serve as tutors for the young
	- But they were still property
		- They could be sold, loaned out, etc.
		- They could be subject to abuse of any kind except for murder
	- A slave, if freed, would become a metic
		- With his former owner as his sponsor
		- See the extraordinary story of [Pasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasion)
