- War between Sparta and its former allies from [[Peloponnesian War]]

## Background
- Spartan king Agesilaus had been successfuly campaigning in Ionian Greece (Asia Minor) against Persians since 398 BC
	- Thebes, Corinth and Athens refused to participate in this expedition, they are becoming more and more dissatisfied with Spartan hegemony
	- Persians, unable to stop this campaign, indirectly pay several Greek cities (mainly Thebes), to incite some actions against Sparta
- Former Spartan allies, [[Corinth]], Thebes and Argos along with defeated [[Athens]] and other smaller cities forge an alliance at a council in Corinth in 395 BC
