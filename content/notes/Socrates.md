## Sources
What we know about Socrates, we know from the writings of others, usually his friends, since he himself wrote nothing. The most common source is [[Plato]], Socrates' friend and student, who features him in his dialogues. Other primary sources include Aristophanes and Xenophon. The standard interpretation of Socrates comes from Aristotle's summary.

The most relevant source for studying Socrates is Plato's tetralogy of dialogues devoted to his life and death: *Eutyphro*, *Apology*, *Crito*, *Phaedo*.

### The Socratic Problem
Various people wrote aboot Socrates, but their accounts differ. Some even speculate that Socrates was not a real person. (though it's not the commonly held view) Read more about the problem [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/#SocProWhoWasSocRea).

## Life
Socrates was born in 469 BC. (ten years after Greeks definitively won against Persians in the [[Persian Wars#battle-of-plataea|battle of Platea]], at the dawn of the Athenian empire) At the end of 6th century BC, literacy has become widespread in Athens, so we can be confident that Socrates received a formal education and could read and write.

After completing two years of military training, he was sent to the borders of Attica, where he stayed until he married. Because Athenians became eligible for public offices only from the age of 30, so Athenian men and Socrates usually spent some time living with their parents, and depending on their social class, they learned skills they would use later in life. During this time, Socrates was attending Callias' open house where educators such as Protagoras, Prodicus or Hippias, taught the prominent men of Athens. From about this time, he started his frequent conversations with philosophers and young men.

Since Athens was slowly sliding into the [[Peloponnesian War]], Socrates served a few years active duty, usually surpressing revolts in the Delian league. His bravery was later praised by many, including [[Alcibiades]] (Socrates' long-time friend), whose life he saved during a battle. Generally, Socrates was known for his upright behavior.

After serving in military, Socrates became popular among the youth, but mostly unknown among ordinary citizens. He enjoyed this anonymity until the Dionysian festival of 423 BC, where the comedy category included two plays involving Socrates. *Connus*, about Socrates' teacher, and Aristophanes' *Clouds*. (which portrayed Socrates in a more negative way)

Afer the [[Peloponnesian War#peace-of-nicias|peace of Nicias]], Athens enjoyed a few years of relative peace during which Plato records some of the first Socrates' dialogues. Of course, this short period ends with the [[Peloponnesian War#the-sicilian-expedition|Sicilian expedition]]. During the hysteria that followed mutilation of *herms* (statues of the head and phallus of god Hermes, who was the God of travel, so the mutilation signified there might soon be some invasion) in Attica, many Socrates' friends are killed or exiled. 

Under the tyranny of [[Athens#thirty-tyrants-404403-bc|the Thirty]], Socrates practiced civil disobedience a lot (although he himself was not really pro-democracy). Luckily for him, the tyranical government was overthrown by democrats before they managed to execute him.

### The Trial of Socrates
Ever since Aristophanes wrote *Clouds*, there has been a growing resentment against Socrates in Athens. This tension culminated in a trial of Socrates in 399 BC. Formally, he was accused by a young poet Meletus of "moral corruption of Athenian youth" and "impiety". The respective archon determined the evidence was actionable and summoned Socrates before for a trial before the jury. The charges were rather vague, but it is true that Socrates said he doesn't believe in the Olympian gods as gods do not do wicked things, and he also expressed some anti-democratic opinions.

As a citizen, Socrates had the right to countersue, and the right to forgo the hearing (allowing him to voluntarily exile himself). Instead Socrates decided to enter a plea and stopped at a gymnasium to talk with youngsters about mathematics and knowledge.

In his defense, Socrates mentioned the harm done to him by Aristophanes' *Clouds*. He out-argued Meletus so easily that the jury probably did not make a fine distinction between philosophy and sophistry. His main argument was that if he corrupted the youth, he did so unwillingly, so he should be instructed, and not prosecuted. However, the jury of 501 convicted him by a majority of 280 against 221.

During the penalty part of the trial, Socrates allowed his friends to pay a fine six times his net worth for him, which the jury refused. In the end, the jury settled for the capital punishment, maybe incensed by Socrates' words, but it is more likely the superstious jurors were afraid the gods would be angry. Sentenced to death, Socrates reflected that it might be a blessing: either a dreamless sleep, or an opportunity to converse in the underworld.

Socrates died nobly and without fear by poisoning from *Conium maculatum*.

>  “If you take my advice, you will give but little thought to Socrates but much more to the truth. If you think that what I say is true, agree with me; if not, oppose it with every argument” (Plato, *Phaedo* 91b–c)

## Philosophy
The key difference between Socrates (+ the [[Sophists]]) and the Presocratics is his turn from nature to human beings and their good. In most dialogues, Socrates concerns himself with definitions of virtues.

### The Socratic Method
Socrates assumes that to settle moral questions we need knowledge of the virtues, and we test claims to this knowledge by seeking defintions of the virtues.

How did Socrates arrive at defintions? He used 3 methods:

1. The *Eleunchus*

A cross-examination of a particular belief or defintion, Socrates tests what the other person says and refutes it. Some think that this method hints at a grand underlying assumption of Socrates': he thought everyone already had the true knowledge, but it was obscured by false beliefs (which can be reomoved by being forced to contradiction)

2. *Maieutic*

In this mode of inquiry, Socrates helps the other person bring their latent ideas into clear consciousness.

3. *Dialectic*

Greek *dialegesthai* means simply "to converse" or "to discuss". This method is in a way the opposite of eleneuchus as in this one you construct a proposition from other propositions. This method is more Platonic than Socratics, Plato in his corpus defines dialectic in two ways. First, in relation to dianoetic thinking, which assumes hypotheses via the senses, so dialectical thinking is defined as ignoring the senses and goind beyond hypotheses to first principles. In the second definition, dialectics is defined simply as a method of collection and division. 

To see all methods clearly in practice, I suggest you read either *Eutyphro* or *Protagoras*.

> I have not done well. The fault, though, is mine, not yours. I behaved like a glutton, grabbing for every dish that passes and tasting it before properly considering the one before. So instead of finding the answer to the question of what justice is, I let that pass and turned to the new question of whether justice is a vice and ignorance, or a virtue and wisdom. Next the question of whether injustice is more profitable than justice came before me, and, once again, I could not stop myself from abandoning the previous investigation and engaging in this one. Consequently, the outcome of the discussion for me is that I know nothing, because if I do not know what justice is, I do not know whether justice is a virtue, or whether a just human being is happy. (Plato, *Republic* I. 354a–c)

> As long as I have breath and am able, I shall not stop but continue with my love of wisdom, to exhort you in my customary manner, and to ask any one of you I happen to meet, why on earth do you, a citizen of the utterly powerful and wise city of Athens, care so much about accumulating money and honor and reputation, and so little about wisdom and truth and that your soul is as good as possible? Are you not ashamed of this behavior? And if he says he does care, I shall not let him go, but I shall question him, examine him and test him, and if I do not think he has virtue when he says he does, I shall reproach him because he attaches little importance to the most important things and greater importance to the less important things. I shall do this to anyone I happen to meet, young and old, citizen and stranger, and more so for the citizens because you are more nearly related to me. This is what the god commands, and I think there is no greater good in this city than my service to the god. I go about every day doing nothing but persuading young and old to care not for your body and for money but to the excellence of your soul. I tell you that money does not bring virtue and excellence, but from virtue come money and everything else good for men. (PLato, *Apology* 29d–30b)
