## Sources
What we know about Socrates, we know from the writings of others, usually his friends, since he himself wrote nothing. The most common source is [[Plato]], Socrates' friend and student, who features him in his dialogues. Other primary sources include Aristophanes and Xenophon. The standard interpretation of Socrates comes from Aristotle's summary.

### The Socratic Problem
Various people wrote aboot Socrates, but their accounts differ. Some even speculate that Socrates was not a real person. (though it's not the commonly held view) Read more about the problem [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/#SocProWhoWasSocRea).

## Life
Socrates was born in 469 BC. (ten years after Greeks definitively won against Persians in the [[Persian Wars#battle-of-plataea|battle of Platea]], at the dawn of the Athenian empire) At the end of 6th century BC, literacy has become widespread in Athens, so we can be confident that Socrates received a formal education and could read and write.

After completing two years of military training, he was sent to the borders of Attica, where he stayed until he married. Because Athenians became eligible for public offices only from the age of 30, so Athenian men and Socrates usually spent some time living with their parents, and depending on their social class, they learned skills they would use later in life. During this time, Socrates was attending Callias' open house where educators such as Protagoras, Prodicus or Hippias, taught the prominent men of Athens. From about this time, he started his frequent conversations with philosophers and young men.

Since Athens was slowly sliding into the [[Peloponnesian War]], Socrates served a few years active duty, usually surpressing revolts in the Delian league. His bravery was later praised by many, including [[Alcibiades]] (Socrates' long-time friend).

After serving in military, Socrates became popular among the youth, but mostly unknown among ordinary citizens. He enjoyed this anonymity until the Dionysian festival of 423 BC, where the comedy category included two plays involving Socrates. *Connus*, about Socrates' teacher, and Aristophanes' *Clouds*. (which portrayed Socrates in a more negative way)

Afer the [[Peloponnesian War#peace-of-nicias|peace of Nicias]], Athens enjoyed a few years of relative peace during which Plato records some of the first Socrates' dialogues. Of course, this short period ends with the [[Peloponnesian War#the-sicilian-expedition|Sicilian expedition]]. During the hysteria that followed mutilation of *herms* (statues of the head and phallus of god Hermes, who was the God of travel, so the mutilation signified there might soon be some invasion) in Attica, many Socrates' friends are killed or exiled. 

Under the tyranny of [[Athens#thirty-tyrants-404403-bc|the Thirty]], Socrates practiced civil disobedience a lot (although he himself was not really pro-democracy). Luckily for him, the tyranical government was overthrown by democrats before they managed to execute him.

### The Trial of Socrates
Ever since Aristophanes wrote *Clouds*, there has been a growing resentment against Socrates in Athens. This tension culminated in a trial of Socrates in 399 BC. Formally, he was accused by a young poet Meletus of "moral corruption of Athenian youth" and "impiety". The respective archon determined the evidence was actionable and summoned Socrates before for a trial before the jury. The charges were rather vague, but it is true that Socrates said he doesn't believe in the Olympian gods as gods do not do wicked things, and he also expressed some anti-democratic opinions.

As a citizen, Socrates had the right to countersue, and the right to forgo the hearing (allowing him to voluntarily exile himself). Instead Socrates decided to enter a plea and stopped at a gymnasium to talk with youngsters about mathematics and knowledge.

In his defense, Socrates mentioned the harm done to him by Aristophanes' *Clouds*. He out-argued Meletus so easily that the jury probably did not make a fine distinction between philosophy and sophistry. His main argument was that if he corrupted the youth, he did so unwillingly, so he should be instructed, and not prosecuted. However, the jury of 501 convicted him by a majority of 280 against 221.

During the penalty part of the trial, Socrates allowed his friends to pay a fine six times his net worth for him, which the jury refused. In the end, the jury settled for the capital punishment, maybe incensed by Socrates' words, but it is more likely the superstious jurors were afraid the gods would be angry. Sentenced to death, Socrates reflected that it might be a blessing: either a dreamless sleep, or an opportunity to converse in the underworld.

Socrates died nobly and without fear by poisoning from *Conium maculatum*.

>  “If you take my advice, you will give but little thought to Socrates but much more to the truth. If you think that what I say is true, agree with me; if not, oppose it with every argument” (Plato, *Phaedo* 91b–c)
