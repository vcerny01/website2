## Life

Little is known about Pythagoras himself. He was  born at the island of Samos some time around 570 BC. He traveled Egypt and Babylonia, and around 530 BC he left Samos to escape the rule of the tyrant Polycrates. 

After settling in Croton (souther Italy), he founded an exclusive community there. He was well-respected and influential, but about 500 BC there was an uprising in Croton and other Greek colonies in Italy against the Pythagoreans. Many were killed. Pythagoras eventually took refuge in Metapontum where he died not long afterwards. (it is said he starved himself to death in a temple) There continued to be groups of Pythagoreans until about 400 BC

> Pythagoras the son of Mnesarchus practiced inquiry [historiē] more than all other men, and making a selection of these writings constructed his own wisdom, polymathy, evil trickery. (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of the Philosophers* 8.6)

## The Pythagoreans

After his death, Pythagoras' followers split into two groups, which mirrored the two aspects of Pythagorean teaching: *mathematikoi* and *akousmatikoi*. The akousmatikoi focused on living by Pythagoras' teachings on religion and the proper way to live, whereas the mathematikoi had a reapt reputation for their philosophical, mathematical, musical and astronomical knowledge.

All members of the cult followed strict rules. For example, due to the Pythagoras' teaching about reincarnation, they were vegeterian.

Contrasted to the Ionian philosophers, Pythagoreans cared more about the basic form rather than the basic stuff. Their core insight is that the chaos of sound can be brought into order using numbers and so they reasoned the entire universe is a harmonious arrangment knowable using mathematics. 

> What he said to his associates, no one is able to say with any certainty, for they kept no ordinary silence among themselves. But it was especially well-known by all that first he declares that the soul is immortal; then that it changes into other kinds of animals; in addition that things that happen recur at certain intervals, that nothing is absolutely new, and that all things that come to be alive must be thought akin. Pythagoras seems to have been the first to introduce these opinions into Greece. (Porphyry, *Life of Pythagoras* 19)

> There are two kinds of the Italian philosophy called Pythagorean, since two types of people practiced it—the *akousmatikoi* and the *mathematikoi*. Of these, the akousmatikoi were admitted to be Pythagoreans by the others, but they, in turn, did not recognize the mathematikoi but claimed that their pursuits were not those of Pythagoras, but of Hippasus…. The philosophy of the akousmatikoi consists of unproved and unargued akousmata to the effect that one must act in appropriate ways, and they also try to preserve all the other sayings of Pythagoras as divine dogma. These people claim to say nothing of their own invention and say that to make innovations would be wrong. But they suppose that the wisest of their number are those who have got the most akousmata.<br>
All the akousmata referred to in this way fall under three headings: (a) Some indicate what something is; (b) others indicate what is something in the greatest degree; and (c) others what must or must not be done. (a) The following indicate what something is. What are the Isles of the Blest? Sun and Moon. What is the oracle at Delphi? The tetractys, which is the harmony in which the Sirens sing. (b) Others indicate what is something in the greatest degree. What is most just? To sacrifice. What is the wisest? Number, and second wisest is the person who assigned names to things. What is the wisest thing in our power? Medicine. What is most beautiful? Harmony. (Iamblichus, *Life of Pythagoras* 81, 82)

> The tetractys is a certain number, which being composed of the four first numbers produces the most perfect number, 10. For 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 come to be 10. This number is the first tetractys and is called the source of ever-flowing nature, since according to them the entire kosmos is organized according to harmonia, and harmonia is a system of three concords, the fourth, the fifth, and the octave, and the proportions of these three concords are found in the aforementioned four numbers. (Sextus Empiricus, *Against the Mathematicians* 7.94–95)
